        <span class="dropcap">W</span>hen we started this journey, we knew it would
        test our staying power, commitment and ingenuity. We had no strategic plan
        but grew organically, always responsive to the ideas and strengths of a
        people who depended on the effectiveness of their ideas if they were to
        survive and meet their own basic human needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first water, food and shelter were the most pressing of these. But slowly,
        as people made the connection between illness and contaminated water, their
        needs shifted from ‘water’ to ‘safe drinking water’.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you work by solving problems as they arise, a picture evolves, and you
        begin to see how tightly survival, technology and development are linked and
        interconnected with many aspects of people’s lives. This understanding is a
        great part of the Barefoot College legacy.

        This ebook has traced the making of that legacy, which has taken us through
        a broad spectrum of activities. They have included drilling for groundwater,
        installing and maintaining handpumps, constructing and deepening village
        ponds and dams, exploring ways to rejuvenate existing wells and open water
        sources, making the most of rainwater by harvesting it, and constructing
        reverse osmosis plants in fluoride and arsenic-affected areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s been a huge criss-cross of ideas and work with communities. What began
        with one set of villages surrounding the Tilonia campus spread beyond
        Rajasthan into other Indian states, and later moved beyond India into many
        countries in the Global South, especially in Africa, Latin America, and
        Southeast Asia.

        Thanks to our diligent barefoot record-keepers, counting the numbers has been
        easy and exciting. Watch Jokhim Chacha, the Barefoot College mascot, lead you
        through its narration. It may sound impressive to say that we have installed
        1735 handpumps in Indian villages, or 27 community rainwater harvesting tanks
        in seven other countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        But figures are only part of the story. The rest is told in the lives of the
        people we set out to help — the ones who live and struggle for survival every
        day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Barefoot College assesses change by the improvement in people’s lives — by
        seeing people’s self-confidence rise, by empowerment being enabled and
        expectations being changed. In practice, all markers of improvement matter.
